# NEKO DBMS
![pipeline](https://gitlab.danielsworkbench.com/DanielB/database-builder-cli/badges/C++Migration/pipeline.svg)

Neko DBMS (Database Management Script) is a simple compiler that takes NekoScript and complies it into PostgreSQL.

## What is the point?
Neko DBMS is to simplify the creation of databases for my smaller projects. This is not a replacement for SQL as knowledge of how SQL works is still quite important to programing with NekoScript.

This came about so that I can create repeatable unit test for other projects that use databases. I want to be able to destroy and create a fresh database for the pipeline. Thus, I created a bash script. That bash script turned into a node application which turned into this compiler.
